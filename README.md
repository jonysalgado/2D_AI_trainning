## Behavior Thee and Finite State Machine

The first challenge is to implement a soccer field that has two players and a ball. Think about how to implement the collision with players and ball. Before, think about the friction on the ball.

Deadline: 13/11/2019

## Search and exploration

The second challenge is to implement a method for player to find the ball and drive it to the goal.
Try to implement a conduction method similar to soccer 2d.
the final state is implement a method to catch the ball even if another player has it.

Deadline: 25/03/2020
